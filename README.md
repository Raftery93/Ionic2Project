This app contains a number of features across 2 pages.

On the first page (home.html), you have a list which adds Strings to Firebase Database.
 This list is then returned and displayed, in can also delete and update.
 You also have a media recorder which records audio. To use this, you must use the buttons in order.
 1)Start Recording, 2) Stop Recording, 3)Start Playback, followed by 4)Stop Playback.
 This page also uses a camera function, which allows the user to take a picture, and then display it
 on the same page.

On the second page (about.html), which is accessed by using a navController, contains a map of a specific location,
 this is done using an Iframe. This page also has a flashlight, which is failing to work albeit the code written
  should have no issues.
